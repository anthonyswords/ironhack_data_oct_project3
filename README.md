## Project Description

This software recommends songs that have similar features with the song that the user inputs. 
From a database of 10000 songs which has been splitted into 10 clusters based on the songs features, the software selects a random song from a cluster depending on the song features that the user inputs. 


## Software Workflow

1 - User inputs a song
2 - If the song is currently on the current Billboard top 100 list, another song from the Billboard top 100 list is returned. 
3 - If the song is not on the current Billboard top 100 list, the software gets the song features from the song inputed by the user from Spotify, and returns a song with similar features from the database cluster we have created.
